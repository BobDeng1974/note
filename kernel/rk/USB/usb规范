协议层：
包:
- SYNC 
 所有的包都以SYNC开始，输入电路用这些信号对齐本地时钟

token：
Field PID ADDR ENDP CRC5
Bits 	8   7    4    5

data：
Field PID   DATA   CRC16
Bits   8    0-8192  16

handshake:
Field PID
Bits   8



四种传输类型
1.控制传输
2.中断传输 (host固定间隔去查询)
3.批量传输
4.同步传输

5.分离传输(host和hub间，匹配host和device的不同速度)

=================
usb框架：
usb设备可分为三个层次：
• 最底层是发送和接收数据的总线接口

• 中间层处理总线上到设备的各种端点的数据。端点是数据的接收或发送者

• 最上层是总线上的功能设备，(鼠标..)

usb设备可见的状态变化：
Attached-->Powered-->Default-->Address-->Configured-->Suspended

枚举：
当端口插入usb设备:
1. 插入usb设备的hub通过状态管道，回复自己的状态通知主控。这时usb设备状态是powered，插入设备的端口是disabled

2. 主通通过查询hub获取更准确的状态
3. 这是主控查询到了被插入设备的端口，并等待至少100ms使插入操作完成，等待电压稳定Now that the host knows the port to which the new device has been attached, the host then waits for at
  least 100 ms to allow completion of an insertion process and for power at the device to become stable.
 The host then issues a port enable and reset command to that port. Refer to Section 7.1.7.5 for
sequence of events and timings of connection through device reset.
4. The hub performs the required reset processing for that port (see Section 11.5.1.5). When the reset
  signal is released, the port has been enabled. The USB device is now in the Default state and can draw
 no more than 100 mA from VBUS. All of its registers and state have been reset and it answers to the
default address.
5. The host assigns a unique address to the USB device, moving the device to the Address state.
6. Before the USB device receives a unique address, its Default Control Pipe is still accessible via the
  default address. The host reads the device descriptor to determine what actual maximum data payload
 size this USB device’s default pipe can use.
7. The host reads the configuration information from the device by reading each configuration zero to
  n-1, where n is the number of configurations. This process may take several milliseconds to complete.
8.
Based on the configuration information and how the USB device will be used, the host assigns a
configuration value to the device. The device is now in the Configured state and all of the endpoints in
this configuration have taken on their described characteristics. The USB device may now draw the
amount of VBUS power described in its descriptor for the selected configuration. From the device’s
point of view, it is now ready for use.
When the USB device is removed, the hub again sends a notification to the host. Detaching a device
disables the port to which it had been attached. Upon receiving the detach notification, the host will update
its local topological information.
